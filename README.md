# text-basedBlackjack
This program has 4 classes which were the Card, Hand, Deck, and BlackJack classes. These classes all did different things related to their name. the deck class had an ArrayList of 52 cards which was the deck. This arraylist was created within the Build method which had a nested for loop for the 4 cards of each number from 1 to 9 and another for loop to add 16 cards of value 10, this all added up to 52 in total. The shuffle method used the Collections library to call the shuffle method. The deal method found the top card, removed it and returned it for use in the hand method where it can be added to an ArrayList of a hand. The getTotalValue method in the hand class was used to calculate the value of a hand for use in the game. This method added the values of each card in a hand to one variable sum which was returned so the game could confirm the winner of each match. The BlackJack class is where the methods of playerTurn and dealerTurn are stored, the playerTurn method is where a player is able to keep asking for cards until the value of it’s hand is 16 at this point they are unable to ask for more cards(hit). The dealerTurn method just checks if the dealer’s hand is less than 17 and if it is the dealer can continue to get more cards until the dealer hand has more than 17. The main method calls all the methods that allow the game to run.
